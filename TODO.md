### TODO
**In Progress**
- [ ] clean up some possibly redundant code:
    - uneeded calls to get icon path in callback functions icon_name_changed and settings_icon_changed
    - file set to filechooser when preference dialog opened, then called again in function settings_icon_changed

**Completed**
- [x] Set filter to filechooser so file picker only shows image files
- [x] Make icon size autoscale to fit size of panel or add spinbutton to let user change icon size between 16, 24, 32, 48 px.
